    "# Problem Identified\n",
    "The task involves evaluating the functional aspects of a WhatsApp application, primarily used in India, by extracting and analyzing the latest 1 lakh reviews from the Google Play Store. The focus is on negative reviews (ratings less than 3), reviews in English, and those with more than 5 words. An emotional analysis will be conducted, and attention will be given to reviews containing the words \"issue\" or \"problem\" and expressing emotions like \"anger\" or \"fear.\" The goal is to identify challenges faced by users and suggest actionable improvements.\n",

I wanted to reach out to let you know that I haven't been receiving the OTP (One-Time Password) on WhatsApp. I'm not sure what the issue is, but I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter. I've made sure that my phone number is correctly entered and that I have a stable internet connection. However, despite multiple attempts, the OTP never seems to arrive. I've checked my spam folders and notification settings as well, but still no luck. Could you please look into this matter and help me out? It's causing quite a bit of inconvenience as I rely on WhatsApp for communication. If there's any additional information or steps I need to take, please let me know. I would be grateful if you could provide any insights or suggestions on how to fix this issue. Maybe there's a troubleshooting method I can follow, or perhaps there's an update I need to install to ensure proper OTP delivery. Any guidance you can offer would be greatly appreciated. If this issue persists, I might consider other alternatives to communicate, but I would really prefer to continue using WhatsApp given its convenience and widespread usage. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon and getting this OTP issue resolved. Best regards, Gaurav prakash tiwari\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The comprehensive project aimed at analyzing user feedback for the WhatsApp mobile application on the Google Play Store has uncovered crucial insights into challenges faced by users. By focusing on negative reviews with ratings less than 3 and conducting emotional analysis, recurring themes have surfaced, demanding prompt attention from the development team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identified issues range from notification inconsistencies and avatar glitches to more intricate problems, such as AI chatbot interference and performance optimization challenges on Android devices. Users have expressed dissatisfaction with the overall user experience, affecting essential features like messaging, camera quality, and multimedia functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps involve translating these findings into actionable recommendations. Prioritizing user-centric improvements, addressing glitches affecting core functionalities, and enhancing overall performance on Android devices emerge as key areas of focus. The development team should consider user preferences, particularly regarding avatar designs, and aim for a seamless, glitch-free experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python-based code developed for this project ensures efficiency, scalability, and adherence to best practices. Leveraging web scraping, text analysis, and emotion recognition libraries facilitates a systematic approach to data extraction and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In presenting the findings, it is crucial to convey the urgency of addressing these issues to maintain user satisfaction and prevent potential attrition. The recommendations should guide the development team in implementing updates and enhancements that align with user expectations and preferences. Continuous monitoring of user feedback and periodic updates will be essential to ensuring a positive user experience on the WhatsApp platform."
